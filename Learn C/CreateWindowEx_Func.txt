                             <--CreateWindowEx-->


CreateWindowEx() is a function in the WinAPI library that creates a window with an extended window style. The function is used to create an overlapped, pop-up, or child window with an extended window style. The function is identical to the CreateWindow() function, except that it has an additional parameter for the extended window style. Here is the syntax for CreateWindowEx():

HWND CreateWindowEx(
  DWORD     dwExStyle,
  LPCTSTR   lpClassName,
  LPCTSTR   lpWindowName,
  DWORD     dwStyle,
  int       x,
  int       y,
  int       nWidth,
  int       nHeight,
  HWND      hWndParent,
  HMENU     hMenu,
  HINSTANCE hInstance,
  LPVOID    lpParam
);

Here is a brief description of each parameter:

dwExStyle: The extended window style of the window being created.
lpClassName: A null-terminated string or a class atom created by a previous call to the RegisterClass() or RegisterClassEx() function.
lpWindowName: The window name.
dwStyle: The style of the window being created.
x: The initial horizontal position of the window.
y: The initial vertical position of the window.
nWidth: The width, in pixels, of the window.
nHeight: The height, in pixels, of the window.
hWndParent: A handle to the parent or owner window of the window being created.
hMenu: A handle to a menu, or specifies a child-window identifier, depending on the window style.
hInstance: A handle to the instance of the module to be associated with the window.
lpParam: Pointer to a value to be passed to the window through the CREATESTRUCT structure.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.






                            <Explaining the "dwExStyle" parameter>


dwExStyle is a parameter that specifies the extended window style of the window being created. The following are the possible values for dwExStyle:

WS_EX_ACCEPTFILES: The window accepts drag-drop files.
WS_EX_APPWINDOW: Forces a top-level window onto the taskbar when the window is visible.
WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE: The window has a border with a sunken edge.
WS_EX_COMPOSITED: Paints all descendants of a window in bottom-to-top painting order using double-buffering.
WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP: The title bar of the window includes a question mark. When the user clicks the question mark, the cursor changes to a question mark with a pointer. If the user then clicks a child window, the child receives a WM_HELP message.

WS_EX_DLGMODALFRAME: The window has a double border; the window can be resized, but cannot be maximized or minimized.
WS_EX_LAYERED: The window is a layered window.
WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL: If the shell language is Hebrew, Arabic, or another language that supports reading order alignment, the horizontal origin of the window is on the right edge. Increasing horizontal values advance to the left.
WS_EX_LEFT: The window has a left-aligned window caption.
WS_EX_LEFTSCROLLBAR: The window has a left-aligned vertical scroll bar.
WS_EX_LTRREADING: The window text is displayed using left-to-right reading-order properties. This is the default.
WS_EX_MDICHILD: The window is a MDI child window.
WS_EX_NOACTIVATE: The window does not activate when it is clicked.
WS_EX_NOINHERITLAYOUT: The window does not inherit the layout from its parent window.
WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY: The child window created with this style does not send the WM_PARENTNOTIFY message to its parent window when it is created or destroyed.
WS_EX_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW: The window is an overlapped window.
WS_EX_PALETTEWINDOW: The window is palette window, which is a modeless dialog box that presents an array of commands.
WS_EX_RIGHT: The window has a right-aligned window caption.
WS_EX_RIGHTSCROLLBAR: The window has a right-aligned vertical scroll bar.
WS_EX_RTLREADING: The window text is displayed using right-to-left reading-order properties.
WS_EX_STATICEDGE: The window has a three-dimensional border style intended to be used for items that do not accept user input.
WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW: The window is intended to be used as a floating toolbar.
WS_EX_TOPMOST: The window should be placed above all non-topmost windows and should stay above them, even when the window is deactivated.
WS_EX_TRANSPARENT: The window should not be painted until siblings beneath the window (that were created by the same thread) have been painted.
WS_EX_WINDOWEDGE: The window has a border with a raised edge.







                            <Explaining the "dwStyle" parameter>
dwStyle is a parameter that specifies the style of the window being created. The following are the possible values for dwStyle:

WS_BORDER: The window has a thin-line border.
WS_CAPTION: The window has a title bar (includes the WS_BORDER style).
WS_CHILD: The window is a child window. A window with this style cannot have a menu bar. This style cannot be used with the WS_POPUP style.
WS_CLIPCHILDREN: Excludes the area occupied by child windows when drawing occurs within the parent window. This style is used when creating the parent window.
WS_CLIPSIBLINGS: Clips child windows relative to each other; that is, when a particular child window receives a WM_PAINT message, the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS style clips all other overlapping child windows out of the region of the child window to be updated. If WS_CLIPSIBLINGS is not specified and child windows overlap, it is possible, when drawing within the client area of a child window, to draw within the client area of a neighboring child window.
WS_DISABLED: The window is initially disabled. A disabled window cannot receive input from the user.
WS_DLGFRAME: The window has a border of a style typically used with dialog boxes. A window with this style cannot have a title bar.
WS_GROUP: The window is the first control of a group of controls. The group consists of this first control and all controls defined after it, up to the next control with the WS_GROUP style. The first control in each group usually has the WS_TABSTOP style so that the user can move from group to group. The user can subsequently change the keyboard focus from one control in the group to the next control in the group by using the direction keys.
WS_HSCROLL: The window has a horizontal scroll bar.
WS_MAXIMIZE: The window is initially maximized.
WS_MAXIMIZEBOX: The window has a maximize button. Cannot be combined with the WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP style. The WS_SYSMENU style must also be specified.
WS_MINIMIZE: The window is initially minimized.
WS_MINIMIZEBOX: The window has a minimize button. Cannot be combined with the WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP style. The WS_SYSMENU style must also be specified.
WS_OVERLAPPED: The window is an overlapped window. An overlapped window has a title bar and a border. Same as the WS_TILED style.
WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW: The window is an overlapped window. Same as the WS_TILEDWINDOW style.
WS_POPUP: The window is a pop-up window. This style cannot be used with the WS_CHILD style.
WS_POPUPWINDOW: The window is a pop-up window. The WS_CAPTION and WS_POPUPWINDOW styles must be combined to make the window menu visible.
WS_SIZEBOX: The window has a sizing border. Same as the WS_THICKFRAME style.
WS_SYSMENU: The window has a window menu on its title bar. The WS_CAPTION style must also be specified.
WS_TABSTOP: The window is a control that can receive the keyboard focus when the user presses the TAB key.
WS_THICKFRAME: The window has a sizing border. Same as the WS_SIZEBOX style.
WS_TILED: The window is an overlapped window. An overlapped window has a title bar and a border. Same as the WS_OVERLAPPED style.
WS_TILEDWINDOW: The window is an overlapped window. Same as the WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW style.
WS_VISIBLE: The window is initially visible.




The difference between dwStyle and dwExStyle is that dwStyle specifies the style of the window being created, while dwExStyle specifies the extended window style of the window being created. The extended window style is used to specify additional attributes of the window that are not available through the standard window styles. For example, the WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE style specifies that the window has a border with a sunken edge, while the WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW style specifies that the window is intended to be used as a floating toolbar 12.




                          <Explaining "hWndParent" parameter>
hWndParent is a parameter that specifies a handle to the parent or owner window of the window being created. The parent window is the window that will contain the new window, while the owner window is the window that owns the new window. The following are the possible values for hWndParent:

NULL: The new window is a top-level window.
HWND_DESKTOP: The new window is a child window of the desktop window.
HWND_TOP: The new window is a topmost window.
HWND_BOTTOM: The new window is a bottommost window.
A handle to an existing window: The new window is a child window of the specified window.
If hWndParent is NULL, the new window is a top-level window with no parent window. If hWndParent is HWND_DESKTOP, the new window is a child window of the desktop window. If hWndParent is HWND_TOP, the new window is a topmost window and is not covered by any other windows. If hWndParent is HWND_BOTTOM, the new window is a bottommost window and is covered by all other windows. If hWndParent is a handle to an existing window, the new window is a child window of the specified window.
